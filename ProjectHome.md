hxMikMod can load and play music module formats produced by tracker programs such as SoundTracker, FastTracker 2, and Scream Tracker. It is based on the libmikmod library originally written in ANSI C.

Currently loader routines for MOD, XM, S3M, and IT formats have been ported.

Alchemy memory operations used for fast sample mixing require Flash 10.
