=How to embed=

Example: [http://zulu-51.nebula.fi/~modplayer/hxMikMod/SimplePlayer.swf here](a 74k file playing a module by Radix).

The easiest way for haXe is to use the haxe.Resource API as described [http://haxe.org/doc/advanced/resources here].

{{{

Player.LoadBytes(haxe.Resource.getBytes("tune_resource_id").getData(),32,false);

}}}

You will also need an event listener to start playback when the resource has been loaded, the same way as with URL loading.
